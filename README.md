# dBI - Business Intelligence Tools for tda-api and TDAmeritrade Developer Accounts

## About
I started this project to apply the skills I have learned while studying at TTU to a real-life project. The goal of the dBI repository is to take API data from TD Ameritrade using Alex Golec's tda-api wrapper and my own python code to analyze the data using Python, and export it into several formats. When I started this project I had little experience with Pandas, Tableau and using Python with Excel, so this project will integrate all three of these technologies into the project. dBI will be able to...
- Perform Portfolio Analysis on a TD Ameritrade customer's portfolio
- Perform Analysis on Individual Stocks or on a custome portfolio by accessing Historical Price and Instrument Data.
- Export the Data collected from the TD Ameritrade API and processed by the program into CSV and Excel Workbook Formats(And possibly SQL or SQLite in the Future)
- Export the data into Tableau to find insights and present the data visually

## Installation and Running the Program
This will be added in the future, if this repo gets attention I will write a guide to set up the project and run it right now, but currently it is not available as an executable. When the project is finished I will make it a downloadable and executable program.

## How to Use

## Credits:
None of this would be possible without Alex Golec(https://github.com/alexgolec) and the team behind the tda-api. You can find the project here: https://github.com/alexgolec/tda-api and at https://tda-api.readthedocs.io
